    Hi! As you can probably tell, I’m Aaron. That’s “ah-run” (the right way it’s pronounced). Chances are that you’ve probably Googled my name and have arrived here. That’s cool, we all have those late Sunday night “Hey I wonder what weird embarrassing baby pictures I can find on (insert name here)” moments. No? Okay maybe that’s just me.<br></br>

If you haven’t Googled me that probably means that I thought you were cool enough to send you here myself. You should be proud, you’re probably even on my official ‘cool’ list. <br></br>

Enough rambling. Now for the mildly-interesting stuff about me. <br></br>

I'm 18 and a First Year at the University of Warwick studying Computer Science. I have a range of interests from code to graphic design to film making to face-swapping my mates on photoshop. One thing they all have in common is that they all stem from my deep-rooted obsession with technology. I could type without looking before I could walk. (Thanks for putting up with my loud keystrokes all these years mum and dad). <br></br>

Right now my biggest ambitions in life revolve around code - I want to be a full-time software developer! Maybe even someday start my own software company, but I’m open to wherever life takes me.<br></br>
